# Static Portfolio Website Generator

This project generates a static personal portfolio type website from a `config.json` file, creating an `index.html`, `styles.css`, and individual project pages for each project defined in the configuration.  The resulting static page can be used behind a personalized domain name (https://your-name.com for example) to present an effective and professional internet presense

  "description": "A brief description of the project",
  "image": "images/new-project.jpg",
